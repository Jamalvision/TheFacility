HVAC stands for heating, ventilation, and air conditioning. It's a system that uses various technologies to control the temperature, humidity, and air quality of an enclosed space. The goal of HVAC is to create a comfortable and healthy living environment for the occupants.
HVAC systems can include:
Heating units: Such as furnaces or boilers, which generate heat to raise the temperature of a building
Ventilation ducts: A network of pathways that allow for the exchange of indoor and outdoor air
Air conditioning units: Regulate the temperature and humidity of a space
Thermostats: A home comfort control
Some HVAC systems are hybrid, meaning they can switch between gas and electric power to heat a home. This can give the homeowner more flexibility and control over how to heat their home, and can also reduce energy costs.
